                \ contagious(ilke measles), while other virus are less \

                \ (depending upon the severe nature of patients) until they\

                \ recommends washing your hands often with soap and after \
                \ for at least 20 seconds especially after you have been \
                \ in public places, or after blowing your nose, coughing, \
                \ and sneezing. If soap and water are not available, CDC \
                \ recommends using alcohol based sanitizer. Wear mask in \
                \ public settings when around people not living in your \
                \ household and particularly where other social distancing \
                \ measures are difficult to maintain, such as grocery \
                \ stores, pharmacies, and gas stations. Mask may slow the \
                \ spread of the virus and help people who may have the \
                \ virus and did not know if from transmitting it to the \
                \ others. COVID-19 can be spread bt people who do not have \

                \ why its important for everyone to practice social \
                \ distancing and wearing mask in public places. Masks \
